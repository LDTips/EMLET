# Machine Learning project & lab
Realised as part of the EMLET (Machine Learning for Telecommunications) course for MSc during 2024L (summer) cycle.

Project includes an analysis of the [CICIoT2023 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iotdataset-2023.html) with usage and comparison of undersampling+SMOTE technique vs no sample preprocessing.

Lab includes a simple analysis of a flashcrowd VoD streaming statistics dataset

## Note
Due to organisational mess, the project contents are in the `project/FINAL` directory
- `example_SEED42_SMOTE_FIX_FINISHED.ipynb` is the main notebook and project report
- `IoT attack classification.pdf` is the presentation used during the project defense
- `neural_pytorch.ipynb` is the secondary notebook containing neural network implementation
- `model_comparison.xlsx` is the excel file with tables comparing results for different ML algorithms

# Laboratory
Single laboratory Jupyter Notebook file is `ELMET-Laboratory-Slawomir_Batruch.ipynb`
